===========

We need to make an installation file for the program that will make it possible to start on OS boot.

We are looking at a full dive environment.  Full screen, its own shortcuts, its own areas

Make sure everything is simple to use and read.

Have a explaination box, but KISS.

This program is going to be a turtorial program to help people who don't know how to use this the OS effeciently.

I am looking into using Visual IDE so I can eliminate a good chunk of coding, if this is an issue to anyone let me know.
Visual Studios is a free program you can get off from dreamhack for free.  (MSAA)
I think we should probably start building a simple drawing of what we think the program should look like when running.
