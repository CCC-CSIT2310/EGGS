===========

We need to make an installation file for the program that will make it possible to start on OS boot.

We are looking at a full dive environment.  Full screen, its own shortcuts, its own areas

Make sure everything is simple to use and read.

Have a explaination box, but KISS.

This program is going to be a turtorial program to help people who don't know how to use this the OS effeciently.
